# shift-keyboard
This is an encoder for text (note: capitalized accented characters and other language characters are not included)
Use if you want, nothing is under copyright, because it's pretty simple. Written in vanilla js and HTML, no framework (I'm an idiot. Can you tell yet?)
Custom changes to the array are on my to-do list for this project, but I have a pretty bad work ethic lol.
